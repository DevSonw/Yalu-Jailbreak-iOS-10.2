# Yalu-Jailbreak-iOS-10.2-iPhone-6
This is GeoSn0w (F.C.E. 365 TV)'s Yalu Jailbreak fork.
My own fork of Yalu Jailbreak for iOS 10.0 to 10.2 by @qwertyoruiopz with support for iPhone 6 and a dark UI.
I decided to make this as Luca added support for iPhone 6 (7,2) on the project, but not on the compiled IPA, so while I was at it, I also decided to play a bit with the project and I added:

* Dark User Interface
* iOS Version Detection
* IPA Support
* This is a Beta Jailbreak, use at your own risk!
* Rename yalu102.xcodeproj.zip to yalu102.xcodeproj

Feel free to play with project as you want. Luca Todesco licensed it under WTFPL (Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License)
This is not the original Yalu iOS 10.2 Project.
Check out the original project: https://github.com/kpwn/yalu102 for updates.
